Bitcoin Dominance Crash Coming Sooner Than You May Think
https://youtu.be/LJTq9dePFk0
The dominance of bitcoin is on the rise again, let’s take a look at the bitcoin dominance chart.
Here we can see bitcoin dominance represented as the color tan or orange, bitcoin is always the most dominate cryptocurrency.  The peak of the bitcoin price in late 2017 corresponded with a high in the bitcoin dominance chart, as depicted by the red cirle.  Then what followed was a crash in the bitcoin dominance, a crash in the bitcoin price, but the altcoin market exploded upwards in a significant way, in the late 2017, early 2018.  The exact same thing is happening now in mid 2019, bitcoin dominance is increasing, bitcoin price is also increasing, but the opposite affect is happening with an altcoin market crash.  It now is very obvious to me that we see about to see a bitcoin dominance crash followed by an altcoin season, where by bitcoin holders will cash in their gains and start trading altcoins in a big way.  Explosive move on all altcoins will be seen.  My pick is Horizon State HST decision token.  HST decision token had an explosive move upwards in early 2018, when it reached a peak of $5.25 usd and now has crashed back to 3.4 cents usd.  As bitcoin dominance crashes, so will the price of bitcoin, then altcoins like HST decision token will explode in value to new all time highs.  HST decision token is primed and sitting at all time lows yet again, ready to be pumped.

## Process

Changes to the website are made by pull-request in order to facilitate review process.

All pull-requests must pass the continuous integration tests which test HTML validity, links and images.

Anyone may participate in the review process. All comments and ACK/NACKs will be taken into consideration but the decision about merging rests with the website maintainers.

## Content Policy

The purpose of the website is to be an official mouthpiece for the Bitcoin Core project as well as be a resource for technical information that has a direct impact on Bitcoin Core software. This can include research, presentations, and developer blogs. 

Where proposed content is about Bitcoin Core project policy, there should rough consensus of the Bitcoin Core project maintainers as a minimum bar and final decision is with the Bitcoin Core project lead.

## Translation Process

Translation of the website is done using Transifex. To become a translator please create an account at [Transifex.com](https://transifex.com/), then apply to join the [bitcoincore.org project](https://www.transifex.com/bitcoincore/bitcoincoreorg).
 
Each document has a header called "Front Matter", which looks something like this:

    ---
    title: Clarifying Communications of the Bitcoin Core project
    name: clarifying-communications
    id: en-clarifying-communications
    lang: en
    permalink: /en/2016/01/28/clarification/
    layout: post
    type: post
    layout: post
    ---

Translators should only translate the `title:` field, and change the language code in the `id:`, `lang:` and `permalink:` fields. For example the above would be translated for `zh_CN` as:
 
    ---
    title: 有关Bitcoin Core沟通渠道的澄清
    name: clarifying-communications
    id: zh_cn-clarifying-communications
    lang: zn_CN
    permalink: /zh_CN/2016/01/28/clarification/
    type: post
    layout: post
    ---

Notice the remaining fields are left untranslated, however in Transifiex, you must copy these fields as translations (without actually translating them).

### Important note

Please be careful when translating Markdown formatting, this must be exact (including spaces). Markdown titles require a space after the header tags, e.g. `## Title`.

Please note that [translations.yml](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/website/blob/master/_data/translations.yml) and [navigation.yml](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/website/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml) should be translated and submitted as normal pull-requests because they are not compatible with Transifex at this time.
